Library for creating simple threads (web workers) directly out of JavaScript functions without external files.


How to build

You can also use the Visual Studio 2012 plugin from [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34790)

2. Execute `build.ps1` (on Windows) or `build.sh` (\*nix)
